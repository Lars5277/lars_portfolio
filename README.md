Welcome to my list of projects.  This is my growth.  I think each project represents a new level of skill.  I will be adding to it often.  

Crypto Auto Update was a project I did in Jupyter Notebook.  It tracked the bitcoin price change every 10 seconds.  Then updated to a .csv.  Jupyter Notebook gave me fits at first, I absolutely hated it.  I had to clear my cache before it would work right, then I really learned to love it.

I am really proud of Farm Load Tracker.  I built that for the farmer I worked for for years.  He will be able to use it for years to come.  It has a user friendly interface, and a pivot table for simple quick and accurate reports.

MLK Speech Webscraped was a python project I did in Jypyter Notebook.  It went together fast and easy.  

Tableau Data Viz Project I did along with the Analyst Builder course.  I am getting better at Tableau all the time.  

I have a handful of SQL projects that I have done as part of my learning.  I fell in love with SQL after learning MS Access.  

I have a few other Python projects I have done in Visual Studio Code.  I prefer VSC over Jupyter Notebook.  It just seems more natural.  RPS is a rock paper scissors game I did to learn Python very early on.  For some reason that game in VSC just tickles me.
